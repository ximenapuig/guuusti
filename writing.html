            <h5>It was the day after Virgil Abloh’s 2021 Spring/Summer 
              “Zoom with Friends” collection for Louis Vuitton’s menswear 
              line; other than the actual day of the show, the toughest day 
              as a fashion designer. August 7th was the day critics, the press 
              and industry experts met on media platforms to critique the top 
              luxury houses’ new collection. However, this time around, Abloh was 
              receiving the most negative feedback he had collected since becoming 
              a fashion designer. Walter Van Beirendonck, the head of fashion at the 
              Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp , an extremely notable designer, 
              had took to his Instagram account to share his thoughts on the collection. 
              Abloh was quick to panic after seeing Van Beirendonck’s Instagram post depicting 
              Louis Vuitton’s collections awful similarity to his (Figure 1). Abloh stressed 
              about similar past critiques knowing that this could take his position as artistic 
              director of menswear for Louis Vuitton…</h5>

              <h5 class="heading-sections">Virgil Abloh</h5>
              <h5>Abloh is an entrepreneur born and raised on the 30th of September in the 
                outskirts of Chicago. Abloh attended the University of Wisconsin to pursue 
                an undergraduate degree in civil engineering.  Shortly after, Abloh completed 
                his master’s degree in architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. 
                Abloh credited architecture for his quickly growing interest in fashion. In 
                2009, Kanye West and Virgil Abloh became interns at Fendi in Rome. Since, they 
                continued working together on Kanye’s brand until 2012 when Abloh launched his 
                first brand, Pyrex Vision. Under Pyrex Vision, Abloh would buy new Ralph Lauren 
                flannel shirts for $40 each, and screen print Pyrex with the number 23 under it 
                in a jersey style way on them; he would sell them for $550 each. In 2013, Abloh 
                stopped Pyrex and started Off-White, a high fashion brand which would soon become 
                the second “hottest brand” (Quarter 2 of 2020) according to the Lyst Index, one 
                of the most important indexes in fashion. While working on Off-White, Abloh 
                created partnerships with brands like Nike, Ikea, Jimmy Choo, Golden Goose Deluxe 
                Brand and Warby 
              </h5>
              <h5 class="heading-sections">Louis Vuitton</h5>
              <h5>In 1854, Louis Vuitton, a trunk maker in Paris established his own eponymous 
                brand which quickly became a high-class status symbol. At the time, horse-drawn 
                carriages, boats and train were the main modes of transportation, yet finding 
                where to take valuables was always a problem. Louis Vuitton sold hand-crafted 
                luxury travel trunks to solve this problem. In 1896, four years after Louis 
                Vuitton’s death, the company introduced the first monogram print, the print 
                which would lead Louis Vuitton to the top luxury brand in the later 1900s. 
                In 1987, Louis Vuitton became LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet and Hennessey) to form 
                the largest luxury goods conglomerate . Since then, Louis Vuitton has expanded 
                into ready-to-wear clothing, accessories such as handbags, wallets and luggage’s 
                as well as luxury household goods while rotating the designers in charge of 
                these collections. In 2018, Abloh was handed the title of Artistic Director for 
                Menswear by his dear friend Kim Jones who left Louis Vuitton to design at Dior. 
                LVMH now owns 75 brands which all share LVMHs’ values and purpose of cultivating 
                an entrepreneurial spirit by being creative and innovative all while delivering 
                excellence.</h5>

            <h5 class="heading-sections">3% Rule</h5>
            <h5>At a guest lecture at Harvard University, Abloh explains how changing anything by 
              3% makes it an entirely new item (an example can be seen in figure 2). Moreover, 
              Abloh completes just 70% of his projects before moving on to his next project, 
              allowing him to work on a million projects at once. Consequently, Abloh’s purpose 
              and products are often criticized due to their similarity to other designer work. 
              In an interview with GQ, Raf Simons, a veteran designer and member of the Antwerp 
              Six, was asked if he was inspired by young designers like Virgil Abloh and their 
              ability to connect with the youth. Raf responded “I’m inspired by people who bring 
              something that I think has not been seen, that is original”. He then expanded by 
              talking about Abloh’s work ethic (3% rule) and the appropriation towards other 
              designers, including himself (Figure 3) and designers such as Gramm and Colrs, 
              A.G Fronzoni, Ryder Rips.</h5>

            <h5>Walter Van Beirendonck</h5>
            <h5>Van Beirendonck is a Belgian born designer who also forms a member of the 
              Antwerp Six and is now the head of fashion at their alma mater, the Royal Academy 
              of Antwerp. In the 1980’s, Van Beirendonck attended the Royal Academy alongside 
              Martin Margiela, Dries Van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester, Dirk Bikkembergs and Raf Simons.
              This set of designers, the Antwerp Six, has been named the most influential designers 
              in history as the arguably played a huge role in shaping modern day fashion. In 1983, 
              Van Beirendonck established his eponymous brand. Since, he been known for his daring, 
              out of the box collections with notable cuts, colors and prints.</h5>

            <h5>Virgil Abloh and Walter Van Beirendonck</h5>
            <h5>On August 7th, the day after Abloh’s 2021 Spring/Summer Collection, 
              Van Beirendonck posted an image of a shirt he had previously designed that 
              read “I HATE FASHION COPYCATS”. He then posted a photo showing the obvious 
              similarity in aesthetic, silhouettes, color palette and overall motif of the 
              stuffed animals on the garments (Figure 1). The similarity between the eyewear 
              for Abloh’s collection and eyewear that Van Beirendonck had done in the past 
              (Figure 4) was later addressed as well. “Virgil did it again,” Van Beirendonck 
              told HYPEBEAST soon after the posts. “This is not just copying, this is using my 
              world, ideas, colors, signatures, cuts, shapes, as his collection mood board. 
              A world and signature [I’ve been] working on since 1985. He is paid a huge amount 
              of money to be an [‘artistic director’] and he has unlimited possibilities to work 
              with anybody in the world – he could have asked me for a collaboration”.</h5>

            <h5>Appropriation vs. Homage</h5>
            <h5>An homage to an artist is a celebration, even elevation of their work 
              by giving them credence and understanding . On the other hand, appropriation 
              is when a person, artist or business takes a piece of culture, art, or of someone’s 
              ideas and then leverages it for their own benefit. This is usually seen from people 
              in a privileged position taking from a person or group from an unprivileged position 
              and then leveraging their art without any appreciation or understanding of the 
              context or its significance . Who is more privileged at this point? Walter Van 
              Beirendonck is a member of the Antwerp Six, the most revered fashion designers of 
              the 20th century. Despite this, their influence fades off outside their niche circle 
              of supporters. Van Beirendonck’s work has only been carried in major department 
              stores through few brand partnerships and collaborations giving him little exposure. 
              On the other hand, Virgil Abloh is one of the most well- known and prominent 
              designers in the world today; he holds a position at Louis Vuitton, the largest 
              luxury brand. He is arguably much better paid than Van Beirendonck and has much 
              more influence outside of the industry. It seems Abloh is in the position of 
              privilege however it is important to note that Van Beirendonck is in the traditional 
              position of privilege as he is a white, European man who studied, and now works at at 
              the best school for his industry. Abloh, on the other hand, is an inner city, black, 
              Chicago entrepreneur that did not study fashion or work in fashion prior to starting 
              his own brand.</h5>
            <h5>Abloh stresses about what his team, the CEO Michael Burk, and the head of 
              LVMH Bernard Arnault were going to say. Has his 3% rule become a pass for 
              appropriating others work? How has Abloh reflected Louis Vuitton’s purpose of 
              driving entrepreneurship and creativity? How will this affect the conglomerates 
              (LVMH) brand image and consequently, brand partnerships?</h5>
